# Restaurant Management System
This project allows a user to manage a restaurant ordering system by giving the ability to add new restaurants to the list of restaurants in the system and adjust the information of existing restaurants.

The server begins by loading three existing restaurants and their menus given as JSON data. From here, the user is able to add a new restaurant by providing a new restaurant name, delivery fee and minimum order price. Once the require information for the new restaurant is processed by the server, the user can then add new categories and items with specified prices, descriptions and prices to the menu. The user is also able to view the three existing restaurants as well as edit their name, minimum order price, delivery fee and add items to their menus.
